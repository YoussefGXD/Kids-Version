          ACRIMSAT is a NASA funded minisatellite mission to monitor the amount of total solar energy received (part of EOS program). The objective is to monitor the solar constant, or TSI (Total Solar Irradiation), with maximum precision and provide an important link in the long-term TSI database. ACRIMSAT is part of a multi-decade effort to understand variations in the sun's output and resulting effects on Earth.</p>

          Jason-1 was lunched to determine general ocean circulation and understand its role in Earth's climate, particularly how ocean circulation impacts Earth's hydrological and biogeochemical cycles
          ,study the variation of ocean circulation, on time scales ranging from seasonal and annual to decadal, and how this variation impacts climate change
          ,collaborate with other global ocean-monitoring programs to produce routine models of the global ocean for scientific and operational applications
          ,study large-scale ocean tides
          ,and study geophysical processes and their effects on ocean surface topography.</p>
